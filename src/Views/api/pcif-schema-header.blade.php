<p>Police Complaint Interchange Format (PCIF) is a data format 
for exchanging civilian reports of negative encounters with 
law enforcement entities. PCIF allows a report to be consistently 
collected and disseminated across diverse systems and jurisdictions, 
including among and between criminal justice advocacy organizations, 
civilian police oversight groups, academics, law enforcement agencies, 
and private enterprise (such as insurance companies).
</p><p>
PCIF is currently available as an XML-based export option on 
OpenPolice.org, and will soon also be available in JSON. It will 
soon also be available for export on Raheem.ai. We welcome your 
collaboration in developing these open standards.
