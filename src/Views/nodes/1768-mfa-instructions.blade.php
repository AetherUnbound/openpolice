    Option #2: Create an Open Police account
</h3>
<p>
Creating an account makes it easier for you to access and manage 
detailed complaint reports. If the account for <b>{{ $user->email }}</b> 
has not been setup yet, you can use the <a href="/password/reset">reset 
password tool</a> to gain access to it by email.
</p>
<p>
If your office needs to change the email associated with its 
access account, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
